# Milestone 2

While completing the task in Milestone 2, we trained a model to separate four different objects from the images received from the webcam. Now the model can distinguish hand shown Rock, Paper, scissors and nothing (just the face of the user). Then we uploaded this model using "Kerras" and "TensorFlow". Finally, we placed the model file into the main git repo.  For this model to perform better, there is a need to train the model with more people. Now we need to be able to work with this model in code.
